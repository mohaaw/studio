### **20 Forward-Thinking Ideas for the Future**

These are more ambitious, long-term ideas that push the boundaries of what a retail ERP can do.

1.  **IoT Integration for Predictive Maintenance:** Use sensors on repair equipment to predict when maintenance is needed.

6.  **Voice-Controlled UI Navigation:** Use voice commands to navigate the application and perform common tasks.
7.  **Biometric Login for Employees:** Allow staff to log in to the POS using fingerprint or facial recognition for enhanced security.

15. **Automated Competitor Price Scraping:** A background service that regularly checks competitor websites and suggests price adjustments.
16. **IoT-based Foot Traffic Analysis:** Use sensors at the store entrance to correlate foot traffic with sales patterns.
17. **Lost Item Tracker Integration:** Integrate with Bluetooth trackers (like Tile or AirTag) to help locate misplaced inventory within the store.

19. **Micro-feedback Collection:** A one-tap feedback system ("happy" or "sad" icon) at the end of a POS transaction or repair pickup.
20. **Dynamic Power-Saving UI:** The UI automatically switches to a low-power, simplified theme when the device's battery is low.
