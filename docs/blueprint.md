## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Dark, desaturated blue-gray (#22272B) for the default dark mode, chosen to minimize eye strain during long shifts in the shop.
- Primary color: A vibrant, saturated cyan (#00FFFF) for interactive elements, chosen for its prominence against the dark background without causing glare.
- Accent color: A vivid, slightly less saturated turquoise (#30D5C8) as a secondary accent, primarily for buttons and active states.
- Body font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font that delivers a machined, neutral look; for clarity and legibility across all screen sizes; Headline Font: 'Space Grotesk', a bold sans-serif that communicates a techy feel, while complementing the clean UI. Use Space Grotesk for all headers to catch users' attention.
- Sharp, modern icons in the primary cyan color. Favor icons with filled styles to ensure they are visible on the dark background. Standardize all icons around a 24x24 pixel grid to preserve space while also making them readable on different screen sizes.
- Card-based layout with a 12-column grid for consistent spacing and alignment. Implement a max-width to constrain content and improve readability on larger screens. Add adequate padding inside cards.
- Subtle transition effects (0.2s duration) for interactions (e.g., button clicks, data loading) to provide feedback without slowing down the user.
